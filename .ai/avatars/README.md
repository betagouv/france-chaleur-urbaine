# AI Avatars

This folder contains AI behavior profiles (personas) that define different ways the AI should respond.

## Usage

Create `.md` files in this folder to define different avatars:
- **concise.md** - Short, direct responses
- **detailed.md** - Comprehensive explanations
- **beginner-friendly.md** - Educational, patient tone
- **code-reviewer.md** - Critical, detail-oriented review style

These are available in Claude Code via the avatars feature.

## Example Avatar

```markdown
# Concise Avatar

Respond with:
- Maximum 2-3 sentences
- No preamble or postamble
- Direct answers only
- Skip explanations unless asked
```
