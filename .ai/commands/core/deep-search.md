description: Run a deep search about a given subject with all the tools you can use

A deep search is a thorough investigation of a given subject, using all available tools to find as much information as possible. Follow this workflow:

## Define what to search

Think carefully about what you need to search for, and which subtopics you should cover. Identify clear, distinct subjects.

## Search

Use multiple parallel tasks to search for each subject you defined in the previous step. In your search, gather as much information as possible to produce the most relevant analysis.

If you need to create folders for each parallel task, put them inside the whole reseach folder so that it's easier to know what researches has been done for each deep research

## Write

Assess in which existing projet it should be more relevant to put this search
folderName would then be stakingcrypto, headlinker, or if not found deep-search

Write a deep analysis result in @projects/folderName. Create a folder like `/projects/folderName/trip-summer-2025` and create the following files:

- `source.md`: Put all the sources you find in this file, including all URLs.
- `raw.md`: Use this file to write your thoughts without any formatting—just for yourself, as a space to think.
- `result.md`: The actual result, with links and everything needed. For the result, write in a concise, simple way. No need for long sentences—be short and direct. Be structured, but not too much, like a human analysis.

**NON NEGOCIABLE** Never write files outside of the dedicated folder. If you need to save some, do it there

## Agent usage

Use `deep-search` agent for your research to optimize the result.
