# How to use Cursor Rules folder

See [Official Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended)

## Numbering

Because it seems last loaded file rule will prevail, number the files to be sure they are used in the right order

## Folders

It seems folders are not recommended, so we do not use it
