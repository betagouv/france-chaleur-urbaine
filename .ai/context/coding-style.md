## Coding Style (TypeScript)

- Prefer types over interfaces; avoid enums (use maps/consts)
- Explicit, descriptive names (Clean Code); avoid abbreviations
- Functions = verbs; variables = meaningful nouns
- Use guard clauses and limit nesting
- Catch only with meaningful handling
- Comments only for non-obvious logic/constraints
- Match existing formatting; keep lines short
- Add vitest tests for non-trivial logic
