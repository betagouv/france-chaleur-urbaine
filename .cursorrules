<style-and-structure>
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code using functional and declarative programming patterns.
- Avoid classes; prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., "isLoading", "hasError").
- Structure files into: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
</style-and-structure>

<naming-conventions>
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., "components/auth-wizard").
- Favor named exports for components.
</naming-conventions>

<typescript-usage>
- Use "typescript" for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid "enums"; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types.
</typescript-usage>

<syntax-and-formatting>
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Avoid unnecessary comments
- Avoid replacing `â€™` by `'` in texts
- Write declarative syntax.
- if need to use a boolean query param, use useQueryFlag from @/hooks/useQueryFlag
- if need to use an array query param, use useArrayQueryState from @/hooks/useArrayQueryState
</syntax-and-formatting>

<ui-and-styling>
- When using DSFR components, Always create first a component in @/components/ui so that we can easily extend it
- Tailwind for components and styling.
- Never use styled-components
- Use class-variance-authority when needed
- Use framer motion for animations.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS using a mobile-first approach.
</ui-and-styling>

<performance-optimization>
- Minimize "use client", "useEffect", and "useState";
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, and implement lazy loading.
</performance-optimization>

<database-querying-and-data-model-creation>
- Use kysely to query the database.
- import kysely using `import { kdb, sql } from '@/server/db/kysely';`
- For data models, read the "in src/server/db/kysely/database.ts" file.
</database-querying-and-data-model-creation>

<key-conventions>
- Use "useQueryState" for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize how URLs (CLP, CLS, TSP).
- Whenever in need for an API GET request, use useFetch from @/hooks/useApi.
- Whenever in need for an API POST request, use usePost from @/hooks/useApi.
- Whenever in need for an API DELETE request, use useDelete from @/hooks/useApi.
</key-conventions>

<postgresql>
- Use valid PostgreSQL syntax with guillemet for table and column names.
</postgresql>

<next-15-and-react-19>
- Utilize React 19.
</next-15-and-react-19>

<creating-a-component>
- Prefer the use of property "variant" and size in case it's needed
- Do not use Box as it's getting deprecated
- Do not use Text as it's getting deprecated
- Prefer creating it like src/components/ui/Component.tsx instead of src/components/Component/ui/Component/index.tsx
- If needed, use class-variance-authority like in src/components/ui/Section.tsx
- Always use `const ComponentName = ` and `export default ComponentName` for main component.
- Always use an object "props" as the first argument of your component

Example:

```tsx
export type MyComponentProps = {
  prop1: string;
  prop2: number;
};

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  return <div>{props.prop1}</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

</creating-a-component>
